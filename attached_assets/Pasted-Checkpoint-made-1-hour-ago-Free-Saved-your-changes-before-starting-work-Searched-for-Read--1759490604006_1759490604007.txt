Planned backend modularity enhancements (20 seconds)
Anladım! Attached dosyasındaki iyileştirme planını sırasıyla ve programı kırmadan uygulayacağım. Önce mevcut yapıyı inceleyip, sonra adım adım iyileştirmeleri yapacağım.


Planned refactoring and component improvements (7 seconds)
Anladım! İyileştirme planını sırasıyla ve programı kırmadan uygulayacağım. Önce bir görev listesi oluşturayım:


Planned task list progression
Good! I've created the task list. Now I need to mark the first task as in progress and start working on it. The first task is to create the feature-based folder structure in the backend.

Let me update the task status and start working on Phase 1.1.

Şimdi Aşama 1.1'den başlayacağım: Backend'de feature bazlı klasör yapısı oluşturacağım. Önce mevcut yapıyı daha detaylı inceleyeyim:


Consulted architect on backend structure (4 seconds)

Planned and initiated backend modularization to a feature-scoped structure

Planned feature migration stages (6 seconds)
Perfect! The architect has provided a detailed plan. Let me summarize the key points:

Migration Plan:

Stage 0 (Scaffolding):

Create feature registry (server/features/index.ts)
Update server/index.ts to mount via registry while retaining legacy imports
Stage 1 (Core domains - students, surveys, progress):

For each feature:
Create domain repository wrapping current db-service functions
Add service layer for orchestration/validation
Move existing route handlers into feature routes using dependency injection
Expose express.Router via feature index
Update server/index.ts to use new router
Mark legacy exports as delegates to new services
Stage 2 (Adjacent domains - attendance, study, meeting-notes, documents, settings):

Repeat the pattern and gradually prune legacy exports
Stage 3 (Peripheral routers - coaching, health, etc.):

Reorganize files into feature folders with minimal code change
Supporting tasks:

Create shared DB client abstraction
Establish feature-specific type definitions
Re-export aggregated types through server/features/types.ts
Acceptance criteria:

server/features directory contains feature modules with consistent structure
server/index.ts mounts routes through a registry
db-service.ts reduced to thin compatibility layer or removed
API responses unchanged (validated)
This is a comprehensive plan. Now I need to implement this step by step. The architect suggests:

Scaffold feature registry and module template, update server/index.ts to consume it
Extract students domain into server/features/students with repository/services/routes
Repeat for surveys and progress
This is a perfect approach. Let me start by creating a detailed task list based on this plan, then use subagents to implement each stage.

Actually, looking at my current task list, I should update it to be more detailed based on the architect's plan.

Mükemmel! Architect'ten detaylı bir plan aldım. Şimdi bu plana göre adım adım ilerleyeceğim. Görev listesini güncelliyorum:


Decided on feature registry creation (4 seconds)
Good! Now I need to delegate the first task using start_subagent. The task is to create the feature registry and module template.

Looking at the architect's plan:

Stage 0 (scaffolding): introduce feature registry (server/features/index.ts) exporting routers; update server/index.ts to mount via registry while retaining legacy imports.
I need to create:

server/features/index.ts - the feature registry
Maybe a template or example feature module
Update server/index.ts to mount via registry
Let me delegate this to a subagent with clear instructions.


Created feature registry scaffolding for backend modularization

Decided on next task progression
Great! The subagent has successfully completed Stage 0. Now I need to:

Update the task status to completed_pending_review
Call architect to review the changes
Move to the next task
Let me first update the task status and then call the architect for review.


Scheduled architect review

Evaluated feature registry scaffolding

Corrected README migration order
Architect bir sorun buldu - README'de migration sırası yanlış. Düzeltiyorum:


Confirmed documentation for Stage 1
Good! Now I should call the architect again to review the updated documentation and confirm we're ready to proceed with Stage 1.


Evaluated migration order documentation for accuracy
Task
Evaluate migration order corrections in README.md and other files. Confirm readiness for Stage 1 (students domain migration) and ensure documentation accuracy and consistency.

Thought for 9 seconds
Result
Documentation contains conflicting migration guidance, preventing Stage 1 readiness. Discrepancies in stage definitions and sequencing across server/index.ts and README.md create ambiguity. Harmonizing documentation is required before proceeding.


Established consistent stage plan (5 seconds)
Ugh, the architect is still finding inconsistencies. The problem is:

server/index.ts has Stage numbering up to Stage 4 and describes Stage 3 as peripheral router reorganization
README.md has Stage 3 as cleanup
The numbering and descriptions are inconsistent between the files
The canonical order is only for the first 3 domains, but there's no clear guidance on what happens after
I need to harmonize all the documentation to have consistent stage numbers and descriptions. Let me create a clear, consistent migration plan:

Consistent Stage Plan:

Stage 0: Scaffolding (done)
Stage 1: Core domains (students, surveys, progress)
Stage 2: Adjacent domains (attendance, study, etc.)
Stage 3: Peripheral routers (coaching, health, etc.)
Stage 4: Cleanup (remove legacy code)
Let me update all files to match this.

Dokümantasyonda tutarsızlıklar var. Hepsini harmonize ediyorum:


Planned next stage of work
Good! Now all three files have consistent stage numbering:

Stage 0: Scaffolding (done)
Stage 1: Core domains (students, surveys, progress)
Stage 2: Adjacent domains (attendance, study, etc.)
Stage 3: Peripheral routers (coaching, health, etc.)
Stage 4: Cleanup
Let me call the architect again to review and confirm we're ready for Stage 1.


Updated documentation inconsistencies
Task
Perform a final check on all documentation updates to ensure consistency across stages 0-4 and readiness to begin stage 1 (students domain migration).

Thought for 27 seconds
Result
Documentation updates were not fully completed due to inconsistencies found between server/index.ts and server/features/README.md regarding stage definitions. Stage 1 cannot commence until these conflicts are resolved and documentation is harmonized.


Confirmed readiness for Stage 1
Good! Now let me call the architect one final time to confirm everything is ready for Stage 1.


Reviewed and corrected Stage 4 label
Task
Perform a final review of Stage 4 label corrections and ensure documentation consistency. Confirm Stage 0 completion and readiness to begin Stage 1 (students domain migration).

Thought for 23 seconds
Result
Stage documentation is now harmonized and consistent, confirming Stage 0 completion. The project is ready to proceed with Stage 1, focusing on the students domain migration, with a clear sequence established.


Completed architect review for task one
Excellent! The architect has confirmed that Stage 0 is complete and we're ready to begin Stage 1. Now I need to:

Mark task 1 as completed (after architect review - which just happened)
Move to task 2: Students domain migration
Use a subagent to migrate students domain
But wait, the system reminder says I have tasks marked as pending review and I should call the architect tool. I already did that and got PASS, so I can now mark task 1 as completed with architect_reviewed: "yes".

Mükemmel! Architect onay verdi. Stage 0 tamamlandı, artık Stage 1'e geçebiliriz. Görev listesini güncelliyorum:


Create feature and module templates

Planned students domain migration delegation (5 seconds)
Şimdi Students domain'ini migrate edeceğim. Önce mevcut yapıyı inceleyeyim:


Opened server/routes/students.ts

Executed wc -l server/routes/students.ts server/lib/db-service.ts

Planned database service extraction and refactoring (5 seconds)

Migrated students domain to new feature structure

Decided on next task prioritization

Called architect for review

Evaluated students domain migration Stage 1.1

Planned surveys migration next
Harika! Students migration başarılı. Şimdi Surveys migration'a geçiyorum:


Move students data to students folder

Delegated survey logic to subagent (5 seconds)
OK, surveys.ts is 729 lines long and contains handlers for:

Survey Templates (CRUD)
Survey Questions (CRUD)
Survey Distributions (CRUD)
Survey Responses (CRUD)
Survey Analytics
Excel export functionality
This is a complex domain. I should delegate this to a subagent similar to how I did with students.

Let me gather the functions imported from db-service:

loadSurveyTemplates, saveSurveyTemplate, getSurveyTemplate, updateSurveyTemplate, deleteSurveyTemplate
getQuestionsByTemplate, saveSurveyQuestion, updateSurveyQuestion, deleteSurveyQuestion, deleteQuestionsByTemplate
loadSurveyDistributions, saveSurveyDistribution, getSurveyDistribution, getSurveyDistributionByLink, updateSurveyDistribution, deleteSurveyDistribution
loadSurveyResponses, saveSurveyResponse, updateSurveyResponse, deleteSurveyResponse
Plus there are analytics functions mentioned later. I'll delegate this to a subagent.


Migrated surveys domain to new feature structure
Task
Migrate the surveys domain to a new feature structure, creating repository, service, and routes layers while preserving all existing functionality and ensuring backward compatibility.


Show work done
8 minutes
Result
Successfully migrated the surveys domain to server/features/surveys/, creating new layers for repository, services, routes, and types. All functionality, including database operations, business logic, analytics, and Excel export, was preserved and verified.


Decided on task completion and review

Called architect for review
