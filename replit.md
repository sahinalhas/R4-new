# Rehber360 - Student Guidance System

## Overview
Rehber360 is a comprehensive Turkish-language student guidance and management system for educational institutions. It offers a modern, efficient platform for student tracking, counseling, and administrative tasks, featuring automated intervention, smart topic planning, and detailed student profiles. The system aims to be a vital tool for educators by enhancing student support and administrative efficiency.

## User Preferences
I prefer simple language and clear, concise explanations. I want iterative development with frequent, small updates. Ask before making major architectural changes or introducing new external dependencies. Do not make changes to the folder `node_modules` and `dist`. Do not make changes to the file `replit.nix` and `.replit`.

## Recent Changes

**October 10, 2025 - Complete System Consolidation & AI-Ready Architecture**:
### ‚úÖ Legacy System Removal Complete

- **Index Optimization**: Removed obsolete indexes for deleted tables
- **Trigger Cleanup**: Removed update triggers for deprecated tables
- **Schema Consolidation**: Single source of truth with standardized taxonomy

### üí° Benefits
- **Zero Duplication**: No overlapping data structures or conflicting systems
- **AI-Optimized**: All data in JSON format with consistent taxonomy for ML analysis
- **Maintainable**: Clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Scalable**: Standardized schemas support future feature expansion

**October 9, 2025 - Schema Maintenance & √áalƒ±≈üma Programƒ± Status**:
### ‚úÖ √áalƒ±≈üma Programƒ± (Work Schedule) Tab Status
- **CONFIRMED OPERATIONAL**: The tab is properly configured and accessible in the UI
- **Location**: `client/pages/StudentProfile/constants.tsx` (lines 81-84) and `StudentProfileTabs.tsx` (lines 162-164)
- **Component**: `CalismaProgramiSection` renders `WeeklySchedule` and `TopicPlanner` components
- **Tab Label**: "√áalƒ±≈üma Programƒ±" with BookOpen icon in "Eƒüitsel Rehberlik" section

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Database Schema Issues Identified
**Problem**: Systemic schema-repository column mismatches causing 500 errors throughout the application
- **Root Cause**: Repositories query tables using `SELECT *` but table schemas don't match expected columns
- **Key Issue**: `risk_factors` and `risk_protective_profiles` tables have overlapping purposes but different schemas, causing continuous column mismatch errors

**Migrations Created**:
- **Migration 013**: Fixed `special_education` and `coaching_recommendations` tables (successful)
- **Migration 014**: Added 30+ missing columns to `parent_meetings`, `multiple_intelligence`, `home_visits`, `evaluations_360`, and `risk_factors`
- **Migration 015**: Added additional columns: `attendanceRiskLevel`, `socialEmotionalRiskLevel`, `dropoutRisk`, etc. to `risk_factors`
- **Manual Fixes**: Added 10+ additional columns (`attendanceFactors`, `interventionsNeeded`, `createdBy`, `notes`, `resources`, `followUpActions`, etc.)

**Tables with Schema Issues** (as of Oct 9, 2025):
1. `risk_factors`: Missing ~15 columns expected by repository (attendanceRiskLevel, socialEmotionalRiskLevel, dropoutRisk, academicFactors, behavioralFactors, socialFactors, familyFactors, protectiveFactors, interventionsNeeded, attendanceFactors, etc.)
2. `multiple_intelligence`: Missing naturalistic column
3. `parent_meetings`: Missing followUpRequired, notes, createdBy columns
4. `home_visits`: Missing concerns, resources, followUpActions columns
5. `evaluations_360`: Missing notes column

**Architect Recommendation**: 
- Current piecemeal migration approach is brittle and prone to regressions
- Need systematic inventory of all schema vs repository mismatches
- Should implement automated validation (CI check or startup assertion) to prevent future drift
- Consider consolidating `risk_factors` and `risk_protective_profiles` tables to eliminate redundancy

- **Technical Implementations**:
    - **Frontend**: Built with React 18 and TypeScript using Vite, employing Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for styling and animations. Form management uses React Hook Form and Zod for type-safe validation. CVA is used for modular, type-safe style variants.
    - **Backend**: Express.js handles API routes and serves the frontend, with a feature-based module structure for repositories, services, and routes.
    - **Database**: SQLite (`data.db`) is used for all data persistence, with a modular organization for schema, migrations, triggers, and indexes.
    - **Key Features**: 
      - **Standardized Student Profiling**: AI-ready 10-table system with complete taxonomy and quantifiable metrics (1-10 scales, JSON arrays). Covers academic, social-emotional, talents/interests, health, behavior, interventions, motivation, and risk/protective factors.
      - **Holistic Student Understanding**: Legacy system with strengths, interests, future vision, SEL competencies, and socioeconomic factors (complementary to standardized system).
      - **Risk Assessment & Protective Factors**: Comprehensive risk analysis using `risk_protective_profiles` with automatic scoring and intervention recommendations.
      - **Automatic Intervention System**: Standardized intervention tracking (`standardized_interventions`) with calendar integration, effectiveness metrics, and session progress tracking.
      - **Behavioral Tracking**: ABC model-based behavior incidents (`standardized_behavior_incidents`) with categorized behaviors and intervention effectiveness.
      - **Data Management**: API endpoints with error handling, input sanitization, and structured logging for monitoring.
      - **Performance Optimizations**: Lazy tab loading, virtual scrolling, progressive loading, data pagination for reports, and server-side analytics with caching.
- **System Design Choices**: The system is configured for Replit's autoscale deployment, using `npm run build` for client and server, and `npm start` for the production server. Global error handling and production build optimizations are implemented for robustness and performance.
